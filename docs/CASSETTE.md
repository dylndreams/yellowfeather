## THE CASSETTE FORMAT

the hardware format is a cartridge with a cassette inside of it, enabling TAPESTREAM.</br>
the music is recorded to the cassette part of the cartridge and is read thru the chip inside.</br>

### TAPESTREAM

basically CDDA but for this form of media.</br>
the chip can read both A + B sides depending what side the cart is on.</br>

### FILE AND RECORD LIMIT

the cartridge can hold up to 16MiB of data and 60 MIN of music.</br>
this means that there is only 30 MIN of music and 8 MB on one side.</br>

### B-SIDE

usually a game will tell you to turn the other side towards you, this enables B-SIDE.</br>
the devs can have the option to not do that by getting ahold of a special cartridge.</br>
the special cart is called a ONE-SIDE cassette and can be toggled with a flag during intialization.</br>
